Somehow, you found yourself here.

Title - [Dilution](https://xkcd.com/765)

Description - Dear editors of Homeopathy Monthly: I have two small corrections for your July issue.  One, it's spelled "echinacea", and two, homeopathic medicines are no better than placebos and your entire magazine is a sham.
