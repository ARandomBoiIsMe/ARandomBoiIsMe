## Hello ðŸ‘€

Somehow, you found yourself here.

Here, have a random XKCD comic for your troubles:

-----------------------------------

Title - [Summer Solstice](https://xkcd.com/2792)

![Summer Solstice](./random_comic.png)

Description - Then I'll start work on my lunar engines to line the Moon up with the ecliptic so we can have a solar eclipse every month (with a little wobble so they're not always on the equator.)
