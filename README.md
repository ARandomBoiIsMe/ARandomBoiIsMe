## Hello ðŸ‘€

Somehow, you found yourself here.

Here, have a random XKCD comic for your troubles:

-----------------------------------

Title - [Sky Spotters](https://xkcd.com/1910)

![Sky Spotters](./random_comic.png)

Description - Where I live, one of the most common categories of sky object without a weird obsessive spotting community is "lost birthday party balloons," so that might be a good choiceâ€”although you risk angering the marine wildlife people, and they have sharks.
