## Hello ðŸ‘€

Somehow, you found yourself here.

Here, have a random XKCD comic for your troubles:

-----------------------------------

Title - [Cougars](https://xkcd.com/999)

![Cougars](./random_comic.png)

Description - If you're lying in bed tonight and you see yellow eyes glinting in your window, are you being stalked by a puma, a mountain lion, a panther, a catamount, or a cougar? Trick question--in North America, they're all names for the same species, Puma concolor! Isn't learning fun? Anyway, sleep tight!
