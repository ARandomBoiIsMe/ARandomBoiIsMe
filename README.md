## Hello ðŸ‘€

Somehow, you found yourself here.

Here, have a random XKCD comic for your troubles:

-----------------------------------

Title - [Chicken Pox and Name Statistics](https://xkcd.com/1950)

![Chicken Pox and Name Statistics](./random_comic.png)

Description - People with all six of those names agree that it's weird that we have teeth, when you think about it for too long. Just about everyone agrees on that, exceptâ€”in a still-unexplained statistical anomalyâ€”people named "Trevor."
