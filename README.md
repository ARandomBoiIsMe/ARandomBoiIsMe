## Hello ðŸ‘€

Somehow, you found yourself here.

Here, have a random XKCD comic for your troubles:

Title - [Undoing](https://xkcd.com/1119)

Description - I've been sneaking out at night and installing lamps on the underside of every photovoltaic panel I can find. Sure, there are upwards of 80% losses, but I prefer to think of them as nearly 20% gains.
