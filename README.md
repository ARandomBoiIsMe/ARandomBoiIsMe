Somehow, you found yourself here.

Here, have a random XKCD comic for your troubles:

Description - The Greeks long suspected this, but it wasn't until April 12th of 1882 that Ferdinand von Lindemann conclusively proved it when he constructed himself the most awesome birthday party possible and nobody showed up.
