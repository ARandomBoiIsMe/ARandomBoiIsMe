## Hello ðŸ‘€

Somehow, you found yourself here.

Here, have a random XKCD comic for your troubles:

-----------------------------------

Title - [Dark Matter Candidates](https://xkcd.com/2035)

![Dark Matter Candidates](./random_comic.png)

Description - My theory is that dark matter is actually just a thin patina of grime covering the whole universe, and we don't notice it because we haven't thoroughly cleaned the place in eons.
