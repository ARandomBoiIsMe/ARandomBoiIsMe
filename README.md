## Hello ðŸ‘€

Somehow, you found yourself here.

Here, have a random XKCD comic for your troubles:

-----------------------------------

Title - [Law of Drama](https://xkcd.com/1124)

![Law of Drama](./random_comic.png)

Description - 'Drama' is just 'people being upset', when someone says they're always surrounded by drama and they just ignore it, it starts to make sense that their strategy might be backfiring.
